"""Recover statically determinate linear branches without subtracting stiff K*u.

Only an unsupported leaf with exactly one remaining member can determine an
end action. Peel these leaves, transporting both force and moment to the next
node. Stop at supports, foundations, nonlinear elements, shells, and cycles.
The displacement/constitutive solution is retained and checked independently.
